Instead of translating manually each page without any authentication , PHP client library can be used .

PHP client library
Google provides the Cloud Translation API client library for PHP as a single package for both Cloud Translation - Advanced and Cloud Translation.

To install the client library:

composer require google/cloud-translate
use Google\Cloud\Translate\V2\TranslateClient;
